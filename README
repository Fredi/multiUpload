  This is a nice code to help you make multiple selectable file
  uploads very easy. It uses the power of ActionScript 3 and Flash
  Player 9 to allow multiple selection of files, Javascript to easy
  integration with your website and server side scripting to process
  uploaded files in the server. This was inspired by the Orkut method
  of uploading album photos.

Documentation and more examples coming soon.
